    <p>
        You might wonder why my site is so plain. It's not that I can't create a clean website, it's just that I consider it a waste of time.
        <br>
        I often find myself constantly changing the design of the site, feeling the need to modify certain elements. 
        <br>    
        That's why i decided to build the site using plain HTML and JavaScript, without CSS or any additional frameworks.

        <p>
            I have experimented with various technologies for coding in the past, 
            such as React, Next.js, Svelte, SvelteKit, Astro, and Tailwind.
            <br>
            When it comes to design, I usually rely on Figma or Photoshop.
            <br>
            In terms of programming languages, I have explored JavaScript, C, C++,
            and Python.
            <br>    
            Additionally, I am currently in the process of learning LaTeX,
            a typesetting system widely used in academia and scientific fields.
            Also trying to increase the speed (wpm) of my typing.ðŸ™‚
