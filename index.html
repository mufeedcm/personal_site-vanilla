    <h1> Hi welcome ~</h1>
    <h2>I am Muhammed Mufeed CM</h2>
    <h3>a student</h3>
    <p>You might be thinking that why's site is so plain.</p>
    <p>It's not like i cant make a clean site, its just that its a waste of time.</p>
    <p>I find myself constantly chaging the design of this site.</p>
    <p>Some times i feel like i should change something or some stuff.</p>
    <p>Thats why I thought i might as well make a site with plain html without any css nor javascript or any other framework.</p>
    <p>Thats all for the story, I buit my personal site with react, nextjs, astro with svelte and many other frameworks.</p>
    <p>as for the version it must be atleast v7 or something i don't remember.</p>
    <p>these are some stuff i tried before,</p>
    <p>For Coding - Html,Css,javascript,react,nextjs,svelte,sveltekit,astro,tailwind.</p>
    <p>i've also learnt - c, c++, python.</p>
    <p>I am by no means an expert in any of these,</p>
    <p>For Desining - Figma, photoshop ....</p>
    <p>Nowadays i am trying to increase my typing wpm.</p>
    <p>I've also tried to learn LaTeX.</p>
